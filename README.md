# BasicReactNativeAPIAndListView
This is my very basic React Native application.
It contains a random number generator which makes use of the Action Sheet API that is unique to iOS.
Furthemore, I have also coded a ListView using a FlatList, in which users are able to show which education level they are and once the item in the list is clicked, the colour of the item changes.
